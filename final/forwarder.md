Install the [Datadog Fowarder Lambda function](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:464622532012:applications/Datadog-Log-Forwarder), in order to forwards custom metrics and logs from Lambda functions to Datadog.

NOTE: You do NOT need to do this, as we are sharing one AWS and Datadog account in this workshop.
